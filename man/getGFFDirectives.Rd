\section{GFF3}{


Lines beginning with '##' are directives (sometimes called pragmas or
meta-data) and provide meta-information about the document as a whole. Blank
lines should be ignored by parsers and lines beginning with a single '#' are
used for human-readable comments and can be ignored by parsers. End-of-line
comments (comments preceded by # at the end of and on the same line as a
feature or directive line) are not allowed.
