* Development
** TODO Add support for legacy RefSeq hg38 reference for assembly pipelines.
    This has the advantage of ALT contig removal, which is nice for STAR.
** TODO Add support for T2T genome from NCBI.
    Can we also support from UCSC?
    Not yet up on Ensembl or GENCODE.
** TODO Package is no longer detaching ensembldb correctly?
    Confirm that this is working with `makeGRangesFromEnsembl`.
    In particular, ensure that `select` verb is not being attached into environment.
** TODO Improve factorization of metadata columns in GRanges return.
** TODO Consider adding mcols support for rowRanges mcols
** TODO Need to ensure that `geneBiotype` and other repeated values columns are converted to factor-Rle for makeGRangesFromEnsembl.
    This is currently the case for broadClass, but not the other biotype columns currently.
** TODO `Ensembl2Entrez()`: Consider returning as factor?
    Check `summary()` method to see if it is informative enough.
** TODO For gene/transcript level, consider using `featureType` instead of `level`.
** TODO Do we need to download additional chromosome information for kallisto?
** TODO Need to add 'mapGencodeReleaseToEnsembl' function.
** TODO Consider also adding 'mapEnsemblReleaseToGencode' function.
** TODO Caching URL needs to show progress bar for large files.
    - e.g. Ensembl primary assembly FASTA)
** TODO Consider adding code coverage for export of EnsemblGenes output that contains Entrez identifier mappings.
    - We expected these to be written to disk formatted via toString.
** TODO downloadGenome functions: Need to include a chromosome file that is compatible with kallisto.
** TODO Look into generating decoy sequences recommended for sallmon.
** TODO Consider creating a GTF symlink for salmon that contains all transcripts.
    This needs to be haploytype scaffold GTF for Homo sapiens.
** TODO Consider adding file caching support for genome downloader functions.
** TODO Consider classing gene/transcript return from EnsDb and TxDb.
** TODO Consider adding better support for CDS, exon, and promoter extraction from EnsDb/TxDb objects in a future update.
** TODO Add automatic tx2gene output for RefSeq genome download.
** TODO Need to include current gene name (symbol) in the synonyms, in case we're mapping to an older reference, such as GRCh37.
** TODO Improve WormBase GTF identifier sanitization.
    - WormBase has some malformed entries in GTF (e.g. Transcript:AC8.13). We may want to add a filter for these.
