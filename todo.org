#+STARTUP: content
* Development
** TODO Consider adding file caching support for genome downloader functions.
** TODO Consider classing gene/transcript return from EnsDb and TxDb.
** TODO Consider adding better support for CDS, exon, and promoter extraction
   from EnsDb/TxDb objects in a future update.
** TODO Add automatic tx2gene output for RefSeq genome download.
** TODO Need to include current gene name (symbol) in the synonyms, in case
   we're mapping to an older reference, such as GRCh37.
